# Sorting-Cars

Utilizes a self-implemented Hash-Table (with an underlying linked-list) that sorts cars based on their model, make, and VIN.

The key is composed as a single string including the car's model, make, and VIN. When the key is passed to the hash function,
the index where the car will go into the hash-table is given.

Once sorted, cars can be efficiently accessed through the hash-table data-structure by giving the key to the hash function.
